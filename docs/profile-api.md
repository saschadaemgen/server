# Stream-Server HTTP API — S6-08 inventory for carvilon-admin docking

Status: **factual inventory** of what the server speaks today. Reflects the
S6-09 snake_case unification (GET and PUT share the same field names; a
profile object fetched via GET can be PUT back verbatim), the S6-12
encryption field, and the **S6-14 direction correction**: `encryption`
is a SOURCE-side property (camera ↔ server hop), not a per-profile
delivery property. The field stays in the wire schema for stability,
but it is now **display-only** — the steering value comes from the
server-global `UNIFI_ENCRYPTION` env. PUT still accepts the field
(silently ignored for steering) so GET output round-trips cleanly.

**Schema is final as of S6-12.** The full profile field set is still
`{name, camera_id, quality, usage, description, codec, width, height,
fps, encode_quality, encryption}`. No more fields planned. The
master-chat can build the admin CRUD UI against this shape with
confidence that it won't grow again before S7. (S6-14 changed the
*semantics* of the existing `encryption` field; the *shape* is
unchanged.)

Server listens on `CARVILON_STREAM_LISTEN` (default `:8555`).

## 1. Profile endpoints

### 1.1 GET `/api/profiles` — list all profiles

- **Method:** `GET` only. `405 Method Not Allowed` for everything else.
- **Auth:** none today (the spike runs on `127.0.0.1`; auth lives at the
  carvilon-server proxy layer).
- **Query params:** none.
- **Response:** `Content-Type: application/json`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`,
  status `200`. Body is a JSON **array** of profile objects, ordered
  alphabetically by `name`.

**Field names — snake_case** (S6-09 unified the GET output with the PUT
body shape; the live `handleProfiles` Fprintf format in `server.go`):

| field            | type   | notes                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`           | string | client `?src=` key                                     |
| `camera_id`      | string | UniFi Protect camera identifier                        |
| `quality`        | string | `high` / `medium` / `low`                              |
| `usage`          | string | `browser` / `esp`                                      |
| `description`    | string | admin UI label, may be empty                           |
| `codec`          | string | `h264_passthrough` / `mjpeg` / `h264_cbp`              |
| `width`          | number | output pixels (0 for `h264_passthrough`)               |
| `height`         | number | output pixels (0 for `h264_passthrough`)               |
| `fps`            | number | target frame rate (0 for `h264_passthrough`)           |
| `encode_quality` | number | mjpeg q:v / h264 CRF (0 for `h264_passthrough`)        |
| `encryption`     | string | wire-protection on camera-side hop: `tls` (default) or `srtp`. **S6-14: GET returns the SERVER-GLOBAL value** (from `UNIFI_ENCRYPTION` env), not the per-profile stored value. Always a concrete mode (`""` → `"tls"`). Display-only; the per-profile field does not steer the pull. |

**Live sample** (the spike's S6-03 default-set on the intercom; reproduced
byte-for-byte by `go run ./cmd/gen-docs` → `docs/api-sample-profiles-list.json`):

```json
[
  {"name":"h264_cbp","camera_id":"679573e101080b03e4000424","quality":"high","usage":"esp","description":"ESP: H.264 Constrained Baseline, 800x1280 @ 15 fps, CRF 26","codec":"h264_cbp","width":800,"height":1280,"fps":15,"encode_quality":26,"encryption":"tls"},
  {"name":"intercom_web","camera_id":"679573e101080b03e4000424","quality":"high","usage":"browser","description":"Intercom (browser reference, H.264 passthrough via WebRTC)","codec":"h264_passthrough","width":0,"height":0,"fps":0,"encode_quality":0,"encryption":"tls"},

]
```

### 1.2 Single-profile GET — **does NOT exist**

There is no `GET /api/profiles/{name}`. Clients filter the array from the
list endpoint themselves. If you hit `GET /api/profiles/intercom_web`, the
mux routes nothing for it and falls through to the embedded file server
(probably a 404 from `web/`).

### 1.3 PUT `/api/profiles/{name}` — upsert one profile

- **Method:** `PUT`. The mux pattern is literally `"PUT /api/profiles/{name}"`
  (Go 1.22 method+path routing). `405` for anything else on that path.
- **Body:** `application/json` (server reads up to 64 KiB, calls
  `dec.DisallowUnknownFields()` — typos or extra keys cause `400`).
- **Name resolution:** URL wins. A `"name"` key in the body is now
  TOLERATED (S6-09: needed so a GET array entry can be PUT back
  verbatim) but silently ignored — the URL path identifies the
  profile, period. Any other unknown field still triggers `400` via
  `DisallowUnknownFields`.
- **Persistence:** writes to SQLite (`profile.PutProfile`) AND refreshes
  the in-memory `profile.Registry`. New `?src=` lookups see the change
  immediately; existing viewers stay on their current hub until they
  disconnect.

**Body fields — snake_case** (this is `profileJSON` in `server.go`,
matches GET output 1:1 as of S6-09):

| field            | type   | required           | notes                                     |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | string | no                 | tolerated for round-trip; URL still wins  |
| `camera_id`      | string | yes                |                                           |
| `quality`        | string | yes                | `high` / `medium` / `low`                 |
| `usage`          | string | yes                | `browser` / `esp`                         |
| `description`    | string | no                 | empty string allowed                      |
| `codec`          | string | yes                | `h264_passthrough` / `mjpeg` / `h264_cbp` |
| `width`          | number | iff codec≠passthrough | 1..8192                                |
| `height`         | number | iff codec≠passthrough | 1..8192                                |
| `fps`            | number | iff codec≠passthrough | 1..60                                  |
| `encode_quality` | number | iff codec≠passthrough | 1..51                                  |
| `encryption`     | string | no                    | `tls` / `srtp` / `""`. **S6-14: accepted but NOT used for steering.** The pull mode is now server-global (`UNIFI_ENCRYPTION`). PUT validates the value (schema stability) and persists it, but a subsequent GET surfaces the global value, not the persisted one. |

**Responses:**

- `204 No Content` — success.
- `400 Bad Request` — malformed JSON, unknown field, validation failure
  (returns the validator's error message in body).
- `404` — not produced by PUT (upsert pattern).
- `503 Service Unavailable` — server built without a `ProfileWriter`
  (cmd/spike always wires one, so 503 on PUT means the carvilon side
  forgot to enable it).
- `500` — store / registry sync error (rare).

**Example:**

```sh
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8555/api/profiles/mjpeg_bal \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "camera_id":   "679573e101080b03e4000424",
       "quality":     "high",
       "usage":       "esp",
       "description": "ESP: MJPEG, balanced (tuned)",
       "codec":       "mjpeg",
       "width":       800,
       "height":      1280,
       "fps":         15,
       "encode_quality": 5
     }'
```

### 1.4 DELETE `/api/profiles/{name}` — remove one profile

- **Method:** `DELETE`. Pattern `"DELETE /api/profiles/{name}"`.
- **Body:** none.
- **Effect:** removes the profile from store + registry. Live viewers of
  that profile keep streaming until they disconnect; new `?src=`
  lookups for the deleted name 404.

**Responses:**

- `204 No Content` — deleted.
- `404 Not Found` — body `"unknown profile"` (sentinel: handler does
  `errors.Is(err, profile.ErrUnknownProfile)` plus a substring sniff
  for `"not found"` / `"unknown"`).
- `503` — no `ProfileWriter` configured.

### 1.5 POST to create — **does NOT exist**

There is no `POST /api/profiles`. `PUT /api/profiles/{name}` is an
**upsert** — call it with a name that doesn't exist yet and it creates the
profile. The carvilon-admin's "create new" UX must therefore PUT with the
new name in the URL.

---

## 2. WebRTC signaling — POST `/offer`

- **Method:** `POST` only. `405` for everything else.
- **Query:** `?src=<profile_name>` — required; `400` if missing.
- **Body:** raw SDP offer text, read up to 1 MiB. Server does NOT enforce
  a Content-Type, but the browser test page sends `application/sdp`.
  `400` if body is empty.
- **Codec gate:** only profiles with `codec=h264_passthrough` are served
  via `/offer`. For mjpeg / h264_cbp profiles the server returns
  `400 Bad Request` with a message that names the right endpoint
  (`/api/stream.mjpeg` / `/stream/h264`).
- **Flow:** read SDP offer → subscribe to the camera hub (which lazy-
  starts the RTSPS pull if this is the first viewer for that
  `(CameraID, Quality)` combo) → build a per-viewer pion
  `TrackLocalStaticSample` H.264 track → ICE gathering → return the SDP
  answer.
- **Response:** `Content-Type: application/sdp`, status `200`. Body is the
  full local SDP including ICE candidates.
- **Lifecycle:** on `PeerConnectionStateFailed / Closed / Disconnected`
  the server unsubscribes from the camera hub. Last subscriber gone ⇒
  RTSP pull stops.

**Error codes:**

- `400` — missing `?src=`, empty body, wrong codec on profile, bad SDP.
- `404` — unknown profile (`profile.ErrUnknownProfile`).
- `500` — pion track / peer construction failed.
- `503` — upstream RTSPS subscribe failed.

**Verifying live:** the spike's `web/index.html` posts to `/offer` and
loads the answer into a pion-compatible JS client. If the dropdown shows
`intercom_web` and clicking **Connect** results in a playing video, then
`/offer` is healthy.

## 3. Stream endpoints (reference; carvilon-admin only proxies, doesn't decode)

These are NOT used by the admin UI directly — the carvilon-server proxies
them through to the viewer. Listed here for completeness.

| Method + Path                       | Codec gate         | Output                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/stream.mjpeg?src=<name>`  | `mjpeg`            | `multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame` (see `docs/mjpeg-wire-format.md`) |
| `GET /stream/h264?src=<name>`       | `h264_cbp`         | `video/h264` chunked Annex-B (S6-02)   |

Also informational:

| Method + Path        | Purpose                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /stream/stats`  | JSON throughput snapshot (`docs/stats-sample-*.json`)         |
| `GET /healthz`       | `204` liveness                                                |

---

## 4. Field-name unification (S6-09 — resolved)

Earlier (pre-S6-09) the GET output used camelCase (`cameraID`,
`encodeQuality`) while the PUT body expected snake_case (`camera_id`,
`encode_quality`), so a naïve GET → modify → PUT broke with a `400`
from `DisallowUnknownFields`. **Resolved:** both endpoints now speak
snake_case (the field names listed in §1.1 and §1.3), and PUT
tolerates a `name` key in the body (URL still wins). The carvilon-
admin client can take a GET array entry and PUT it back verbatim.

The S6-09 round-trip is locked down by
`TestProfiles_GetPut_RoundTrip` in `server_tuning_test.go`. S6-14
updates the same test to assert that GET `encryption` reflects the
SERVER-GLOBAL value and that the per-profile field is preserved
in storage but not used for steering.

### S6-14 — encryption is a SOURCE property

Earlier (S6-12) the `encryption` field lived per profile and steered
the pull. That had two problems:

1. **Wrong layer.** SRTP/TLS describes the camera-side hop, not the
   per-consumer delivery. Two profiles for the same camera with
   different encryption made no physical sense (we can't pull the
   same camera twice with two protocols simultaneously without
   doubling source load).
2. **Env override silently broken.** A canonicalization step
   (`empty → "tls"`) inside the per-profile path always populated
   the sourcereg key with `"tls"`, so the env-level fallback never
   fired and `UNIFI_ENCRYPTION=srtp` was ignored.

**Resolution:** the steering value is now the server-global setting
fed in via `cmd/spike` (env `UNIFI_ENCRYPTION`). The per-profile
field is kept in the schema (PUT still accepts and persists it) so
the wire shape is stable and the GET-PUT round-trip works, but it
is **display-only** — GET surfaces the global value, regardless of
what was Put.

Locked down by `TestSourceKeyFor_IgnoresProfileEncryption`,
`TestSourceKeyFor_UsesServerGlobal`, and
`TestSourceKeyFor_EmptyServerEncryptionDefaultsToTLS` in
`server_tuning_test.go`, plus the streambackend round-trip tests.

### Other API limits (not bugs, just shape)

- **No HTTP create endpoint.** `POST /api/profiles` does not exist —
  use `PUT /api/profiles/{newname}`, which is an upsert. A name that
  doesn't exist yet is created; one that does is updated.
- **No single-profile GET.** Clients fetch the array and filter
  locally. The list is small (typically <10 profiles); a dedicated
  endpoint isn't worth the surface area today.

---

## 5. Shape mismatch vs. go2rtc

The carvilon-server's previous admin path called go2rtc's
`GET /api/streams`. The two response shapes are fundamentally
incompatible:

### 5.1 go2rtc `GET /api/streams`

Returns a **JSON object** (map) keyed by stream name. Each value has
exactly two fields, both produced by go2rtc's `Stream.MarshalJSON`:

```go
// go2rtc/internal/streams/stream.go
func (s *Stream) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
    var info = struct {
        Producers []*Producer   `json:"producers"`
        Consumers []core.Consumer `json:"consumers"`
    }{...}
    return json.Marshal(info)
}
```

Wire example (shape only):

```json
{
  "intercom": {
    "producers": [{ "url": "rtsp://...", ... }],
    "consumers": []
  },
  "ai360": {
    "producers": [...],
    "consumers": [...]
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Our `GET /api/profiles`

Returns a **JSON array** of profile-configuration objects. Each entry has
profile metadata (name, camera, quality, usage, codec, encode params) and
does NOT have producers / consumers — those concepts live separately in
`GET /stream/stats` (per-profile + per-client throughput counters).

### 5.3 What the carvilon-admin sees today

If the carvilon-admin client does:

```go
var streams map[string]StreamInfo  // go2rtc-shape
if err := json.Unmarshal(body, &streams); err != nil { ... }
```

and `body` is our `[{...},{...},...]` array, the unmarshal fails with
"cannot unmarshal array into Go value of type map[string]...". That's
the most likely path to the live "streams: profile not found" + "Aktive
Profile (0)" the briefing reports — the admin client treats the parse
failure as "no streams" and renders an empty list.

A second possibility: the admin client is still calling the literal path
`/api/streams` (which we never registered). Our mux falls through that
path to the embedded `web/` file server — which returns a 404 HTML page
or the spike's `index.html`. Either way the admin client sees garbage
and reports "0 profiles".

**This is for the master-chat to decide:** either the carvilon-side
client switches to call our `GET /api/profiles` and parse the array (the
S5/S6 contract), or we add a go2rtc-shape-compatible adapter endpoint
on our side. Both are achievable; the briefing's scope (§6) explicitly
excludes either fix from this S6-08 inventory.
